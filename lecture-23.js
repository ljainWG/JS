// importance of call back functions
// how async functions are executed with js
// callback hell, pyramid of doom
// callback hell is a situation where you have a lot of nested callbacks which makes the code hard to read and maintain and understand and debug
// it causes the horizontal scaling of code instead of vertical scaling which again makes it hard to read, maintain, understand and debug the code
// it can be avoided by using promises, async/await, generators, observables, etc

// Inversion of control
// giving of control of our written piece of code/ function to some other code/ function and we dont know what happens in the behind now ?
